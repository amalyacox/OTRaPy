# OTRaPy
v0.0.1
OTRaPy is a package for solving thermal transport in 2D materials and thin films via the **O**pto**T**hermal **Ra**man technique with **Py**thon. 

Currently, OTRaPy can model and fit power dependent raman data of already fitted experimental spectra. Depending on the experimental data and given parameters, it can fit for anisotropic and isotropic in-plane thermal transport. The package contains helper functions for fitting a series of power dependent spectra, but this is still slightly under development. 

Full scripting of fitting experimental data, modeling, and storing the data is coming in v1.0.0. 

To install : 
```pip install - e otrapy . ```

Please refer to the examples for usage.
